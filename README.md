## Introduction
This study aims to analyze the impact of travel history on the Monkey Pox pandemic in Europe.
On May 6, 2022, a monkeypox outbreak was confirmed. It started with a British citizen who on April 29, 2022, after visiting Nigeria(where the disease is endemic), displayed symptoms that were consistent with monkeypox. On May 4, the resident returned to the UK, resulting in the outbreakâ€™s index case in that nation.
**This project gives great insight into the effect of travel history on an endemic area to the spread of the virus in Europe.**

## Problem Statement
1) How many Countries were affected by the Monkey Pox Pandemic?
2) How many cases were confirmed in all the regions of the world?
3) Which Region had the highest number of confirmed Cases?
4) How many Monkey Pox cases were confirmed in Europe?
5) How Many European countries had more than 200 confirmed Cases?
6) Which European country had the highest number of Monkeypox Confirmed cases?
7) What is the impact of Travel history on the Pandemic?


	## Project Design
This dataset was taken from the Kaggle site which contains data from three different sets.
To avoid false analysis, Google Sheets were used to clean the data, removing all empty cells and duplicates.

### pivot table

## Visualization
Visualization was done correctly using Tableau.

The report comproses of two pages:

- World monkeypox prevalence
- Impact of traveling on monkeypox pandemic in Europe

## Analysis

## World monkeypox prevalence
![World-MonkeyPox-Prevalence](https://github.com/Kingkene/Impact-of-Traveling-on-Monkeypox-Pandemic-in-Europe/assets/120706444/897d821e-cfb8-45eb-9522-717e233bd690)

 Total of 41 countries in Europe are affected, 3 Northern American and 81 countries from other regions of the world.
 Northern America has the highest number of Confirmed cases, followed by Europe. 
 Europe had 22,229 number of confirmed cases.
 
 ## Impact of traveling on monkeypox pandemic in Europe
![Impact-of Travel](https://github.com/Kingkene/Impact-of-Traveling-on-Monkeypox-Pandemic-in-Europe/assets/120706444/e1520be0-51d4-4421-b226-de8822f1ec3e)

Spain is the European country with the highest number of comfirmed cases 6884.
Wales and Slovenia have the lowest number of confirmed cases at 45.
Germany and Italy have the highest number Travel History of 19.
Span which has the highest number of confirmed cases of 6884 has travel history record of 2.

## Conclusion 

- A critical observation of the analyzed data and Visuals reveals that Spain, the European country with the highest number of Confirmed cases, has a very low number of recorded travel history of 2 while Germany 
and  Italy have the highest number of recorded Traveled History of 19 have confirmed cases of 3530 and 805 respectively.
- Therefore is no direct proportional impact of travel History on the monkeypox pandemic in Europe.

 ## Recomendation
 In Northern America, travel history has an increasing impact on the spread of monkeypox. 
 while in Europe there is no clear direct increasing impact of travel history on the spread of monkeypox in that region. 
 
 **Other factors that increase the transmission of the virus should be looked into and studied to unfold the leading cause of the high of the virus in Europe.**
