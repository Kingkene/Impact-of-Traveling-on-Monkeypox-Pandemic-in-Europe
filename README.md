## Introduction
This study aims to analyze the impact of travel history on the Monkey Pox pandemic in Europe.
On May 6, 2022, a monkeypox outbreak was confirmed. It started with a British citizen who on April 29, 2022, after visiting Nigeria(where the disease is endemic), displayed symptoms that were consistent with monkeypox. On May 4, the resident returned to the UK, resulting in the outbreakâ€™s index case in that nation.
This project gives great insight into the effect of travel history on an endemic area to the spread of the virus in Europe.
